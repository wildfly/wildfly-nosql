The goal is no-nonsense improvements focused on making the developerâ€™s life easier when using NoSQL on WildFly.  In particular, not to hide and abstract the underlying access APIs but to give simpler and more natural access to them.  The configuration allows NoSQL database connection profiles to be defined, to be used by deployed applications.  The CDI access simplifies application access to the defined NoSQL database connection profiles.
